The Informed Project is a mobile application that I've proposed myself as a challenge. Despite of that, I made sure it would look like an app I would use myself (perhaps I'm already using it, by now).

Informed keeps you updated. Better than that old nostalgic newspaper, it delivers you only the steeming articles about what you really care about, at the time of your breakfast. As a bonus, it also gives you information about the climate, helping you better prepare for the weekend!

Now, for the specifics...
